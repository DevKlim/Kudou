  <i>The AI-Powered, Agentic Game Engine</i>
</p>

## The power of Godot, supercharged with AI.

**Kudou** is a fork of the incredible **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)**, reimagined to integrate AI solutions and agentic workflows directly into the game development process. Our mission is to make creating games dramatically faster and more accessible by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Think of Kudou as the "Cursor for Godot"â€”an intelligent, agentic partner that helps you code, design, and create. By connecting to local LLMs or your preferred AI APIs, Kudou provides tools to automate tedious tasks, generate code and assets, and offer intelligent assistance, allowing you to focus on your creative vision.

While enhanced with AI, Kudou retains the complete feature set of Godot. It's a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine for creating 2D and 3D games from a unified interface, with the added benefit of an AI co-developer.

This project is made possible by the foundational work of the Godot Engine developers and its vibrant community. Godot was originally created by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and [Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) and open-sourced in 2014. We are immensely grateful for their commitment to open-source game development.

## Getting the Engine

### Binary Downloads

Official binaries for Kudou are not yet available. For now, you will need to compile the engine from source.

### Compiling from source

Kudou uses the same build system as Godot. Please [see the official Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling) for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

## Community and Contributing

Kudou is a new and growing project. We are looking for contributors who are passionate about the intersection of AI and game development.

To get started contributing to the project, please see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Documentation

Kudou's documentation is currently under development. For engine and API references, the [official Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org) remains the best resource, as Kudou maintains API compatibility.
